# Print-Jobs-React-App

I developed a sleek and modern application using React with Vite as the bundler, incorporating the Ant Design library for a clean and professional interface. To elevate the user experience, I customized Ant Design with a glassmorphism aesthetic, giving the UI a translucent, frosted glass effect that adds depth and elegance to the visuals. The application currently operates with dummy data, providing a responsive and visually appealing layout that showcases the design potential and functionality of the interface.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

your application will be started on the following address:
[localhost](http://localhost:5173/)
